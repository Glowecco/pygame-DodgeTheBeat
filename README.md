# pygame-DodgeTheBeat

*To extend my learning in Python, I wanted to challenge myself in recreating a video game with Pygame.*

Dodge the Beat is a game I created back when I was in middle school using scratch.mit.edu (link at the bottom). I thought I didn't have to explore too far out to choose which game to try recreate, I rather thought it would be a fun oppurtunity to try replicate a game I made as a hobby a few years ago. But this time, I would be building it in written codes instead of stacking code blocks :)

The game's artwork might look a little rough since I am trying to keep as much as I can from the original game. Please keep in mind that I am new to Git and GitHub, so I appreciate your patience if there are any issues.

### How to Run the game
Run the 'engine.py' file.
