# pygame-DodgeTheBeat

Dodge the Beat is a game I created back when I was in middle school using scratch.mit.edu (link at the bottom). Since I am currently learning Pygame, I saw an opportunity to replicate the game using Python.

The game's artwork might look a little rough since I am trying to keep as much as I can from the original game. Please keep in mind that I am new to Git and GitHub, so I appreciate your patience if there are any issues.

### How to Play
To play the game, run the 'act.py' file.
